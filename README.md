# Fretboard-Practice

To help with learning the guitar fretboard.  Couldn't find a method I liked and this seems to work.  Original idea was to make it a game but that was just distracting.

The tuning notes on the left and the section bars on top are clickable and control which notes are displayed.
These choices are cookie saved so they'll be there on the next visit.

It worked well to learn a section at a time and remove strings as I knew them, and when I picked up the guitar the note locs were completely obvious.

String tunings on the left can be hidden to make note counting less tempting.

String tunings are made to be easily altered at some point - the algorithm looks at these notes and lays out the string notes so changing the tunings is mostly already built in.

Code is all plain ol' css, vanilla js and jquery.  Feel free to do whatever you want with it, no credit required or toss me a Gibson ES-335 if you're feeling flush or work in Amsterdam would be cool.
