# Fretboard-Practice

To help with learning the guitar fretboard.  Couldn't find a method I liked and this seems to work.

The tuning notes on the left and the section bars on top are clickable and control which notes are displayed.
These choices are cookie saved so they'll be there on the next visit.

String tunings on the left can be hidden to make note counting less tempting.

String tunings are made to be easily altered at some point - the algorythm looks at these notes and lays out the string notes so changing the tunings is mostly already built in.

Code is all plain ol' css, vanilla js and jquery
